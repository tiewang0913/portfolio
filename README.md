# About Me
I am a Computer Systems Technology graduate from Saskatchewan Polytechnic with a strong interest in backend development and data-related systems.

During my studies in Canada, I focused on building practical skills through hands-on projects, including API development, database design, and data processing workflows. I enjoy learning how software systems work in practice and applying foundational concepts to real problems.

I am currently seeking an entry-level or junior software role in Canada, where I can continue developing my skills, contribute to team projects, and grow under experienced mentorship.


# Skills & Background
I focus on building backend features and data-related components through coursework and hands-on projects. I have experience implementing REST APIs, working with relational and NoSQL databases, and handling basic data processing tasks in a project setting.

I enjoy learning how different components of a system work together and applying best practices to write clear and reliable code. I aim to keep my designs simple and readable while continuing to improve through practice and feedback.
